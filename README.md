Here you find the code for my project "The Swiss case: Reactions of the real economy to the discontinuation of the exchange rate floor in 2015. A synthetic control approach".

The code is written entirely in python. The structure is based on the template by Professor Gaudecker. 

The code can be run using waf by tipping "python waf.py configure build install" in a shell.

The documentation gives a short explaination of the structure of the project and about what the program is actually doing.

I deleted most parts of the main paper, as it is a term paper for another course and should therefore not be considered for grading.
I left some parts for illustrative purposes.
